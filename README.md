# Book Store Web Application

I developed this application using MERN (JavaScript) stack, under the guidance of FreeCodeCamp's MERN stack You Tube tutorial.

The Book Store Web Application is a full-stack MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) project that allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on books. The application includes both front-end and back-end functionalities, providing an interactive interface to manage a bookstoreâ€™s inventory.

Key Features:-

Backend CRUD Operations: The backend supports the creation, viewing, updating, and deletion of books stored in a MongoDB database, with API routes handled through Express.js.
Backend Router and CORS Policy: The app implements Express routers for routing different HTTP requests, and CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) policies to handle client-server communication.
Frontend CRUD Operations: On the frontend, users can interact with the application to create, view, edit, and delete books. The frontend is built using React, ensuring a dynamic and responsive user experience.
Frontend Router: The application uses React Router for navigation between different views, such as the list of books and individual book details.
View Options: Users can view books in either a card view or a table view, making it easy to browse and manage the inventory.
This project demonstrates the full use of the MERN stack for a complete web application, including both frontend and backend integration, data handling with MongoDB, and efficient routing with React and Express.
